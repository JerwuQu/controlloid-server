This is the server for the [Controlloid](https://github.com/experiment322/controlloid-client) application.

## Windoze instructions

* This takes a while and you should accept all the prompts for a successful install
* Press any key to close the setup window
* You can see available addresses on the server window (**DO NOT CLOSE IT**)
* Pick one in the same network as your phone and write it exactly in the application
* Have fun!
